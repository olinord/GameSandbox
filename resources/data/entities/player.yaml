#The player should be kinematic and have a circle as the collision shape for the feet
#Another collision shape should be for the torso and a final one for the head

#That way the running/jumping/walking animation can be tied to the rotation of the 
#circle and the impacts of the feet/torso/head be calculated with different health subtractions
